5-HTPP Verbs are GET and POST: GET > to get some data from the servers.  POST > to send some data to the server.

6-HTTP Request: a request made by user to a named host which is located on a server for example: news.yahoo.com

7- HTTP response: a response from a server to the user which follows the http protocol e.g sending back HTML/CSS/JavaScriptetc.
